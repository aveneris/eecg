He worked on numerous consulting projects in the area of computer engineering. Presently, he is a Principal Software Engineer at the Altera Toronto Technology Center.

His research interests include computer architecture and FPGA technology. He has co-authored five books and has published over 150 scientific papers. His books Computer "Organization" (co-authored by V.C. Hamacher and S.G. Zaky), "Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design" (co-authored by S. Brown), and "Fundamentals of Digital Logic with Verilog Design" (co-authored by S. Brown) have become widely used (worldwide) in undergraduate courses on these subjects.

He represented Canada in numerous chess competitions. He holds the title of International Master.
