### Biography
Hans-Arno Jacobsen is a professor of Computer Engineering. He directs and leads the research activities of the Middleware Systems Research Group (msrg.org).

His research aims to ease the development of scalable, reliable, and secure ultra-large-scale distributed applications. In pursuit of these objectives, he engages in basic research on event processing, publish/subscribe, service-orientation, aspect-orientation, and green middleware. In research and development engagements with various companies, he pursues projects on large-scale business process management, service delivery models, service and infrastructure management, and e-energy.

Selected research projects include the PADRES Events & Services Bus (padres.msrg.org) for effective business process management, the eQoSystem project (eQoSystem.msrg.org) for declarative monitoring and control of SLAs (service level agreements) in enterprise applications and business artifacts, and the AspeCtC (ACC) project (aspeCtC.net) for increasing modularity in systems software and embedded systems.

Arno received his PhD degree from Humboldt University, Berlin in 1999 and his M.A.Sc. degree from the University of Karlsruhe, Germany in 1994.  Between 1992 and 1998, Arno engaged in pre-doctoral research activities working at various research laboratories worldwide. including LIFIA in Grenoble, France, ICSI in Berkeley, U.S., and LBNL in Berkeley, U.S. After completing his doctorate between 1998 and 1999, Arno engaged in post-doctoral research at INRIA in Rocquencourt, France, before joining the University of Toronto in 2001.

Arno has served as program committee member of various international conferences, including ICDCS, ICDE, Middleware, SIGMOD, OOPSLA and VLDB.  He was the Program Chair of the 5th International Middleware Conference and the General Chair of the Inaugural International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems 2007. He is among the initiators of the DEBS (debs.org) conference series and the Event-based.org (event-based.org) research portal. Further information is available from msrg.org.
