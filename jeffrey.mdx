### Biography

Mark Jeffrey received the PhD degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2019, and the MASc and BASc degrees from the University of Toronto in 2011 and 2009, respectively. Broadly, his research interests are in the areas of computer architecture and computer systems, with an emphasis on parallel computer architecture, accelerator architectures, parallel programming models, compilers, and hardware/software co-design for parallelization, performance, and efficiency. Dr. Jeffrey spent his postdoc year as a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research, collaborating with production teams to improve datacenter systems for distributed training in machine learning. He has also worked in software engineering at Google, Epson, and a Y-combinator startup called AeroFS.

### Research Interests

Prof. Jeffrey's current research focuses on (i) new programming models and compilers that easily express challenging types of parallelism and (ii) new large-scale multicore and accelerator architectures that extract the parallelism.

### Honours and Awards

- Facebook Fellowship, 2017
- IEEE Micro Top Picks Honourable Mention, 2016
- IEEE Micro Top Picks, 2015
