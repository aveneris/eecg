### Biography

Dr. Shurui Zhou is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. She obtained her PhD in May 2020 in the Institute for Software Research, School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

Her research focuses on helping distributed and interdisciplinary software teams to collaborate more efficiently, especially in the context of modern open-source collaboration forms, fork-based development, and interdisciplinary teams when building AI-enabled systems or scientific software. To achieve her goals, she combines advances in tooling and software engineering principles with insights from other disciplines that study human collaboration (e.g., Organizational Behavior), for which she combines and mixes a wide range of research methods.

Professor Zhou has collaborated with researchers from different universities with different backgrounds. These collaborations have resulted in ACM and IEEE publications which have been presented at international conferences in software engineering.

### Research Interests

Prof. Zhou is focusing on helping distributed and interdisciplinary software teams to collaborate more efficiently and build high-quality software systems, especially in the context of modern open-source collaboration forms, fork-based development, and interdisciplinary teams when building AI-enabled systems or scientific software.
